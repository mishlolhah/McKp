        <br>Jeff was one of the competitors in SOS.
        <br>His famous catchphrase "My Name Jeff" was not only his nickname,
        <br>but also one of the only things he was able to say.
        <br>Dr. Mosquito attempted to team up with other survivors,
        <br>but Jeff seemed to be the only one who hasn't muted him.
        <br>Mosquito waited for Jeff on the bridge, who promised to be on his way to his position.
        <br>When Mosquito went into his presumed direction Jeff shouted he's getting shot at.
        <br>The next thing Mosquito heard was a male voice claiming he just killed Jeff.[1] Mosquito acted as he would team up with the murderer,
        <br>only to stab him to death in the moment he lowered his guard.[2] Mosquito died himself later, but at least he was able to avenge Jeff's death.
